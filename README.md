# Bank Customer Churn Prediction with Nerual Networks

Welcome to the Bank Customer Churn Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for developing a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn from their bank accounts.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To build a machine learning model that predicts customer churn for banks.

- **Dataset**: We are using a comprehensive dataset that includes customer account information across three countries: Germany, France, and Spain. The dataset includes features such as credit scores, bank balances, gender, and other relevant customer information.

- **Approach**: We are employing neural networks, a powerful machine learning technique, to create a predictive model. Our custom optimization function explores various combinations of nodes and layers to maximize the model's predictive accuracy.
